# Sheba App Clone (Homepage) With React Native

I have made a Sheba App clone. I was quite easy and I enjoyed while making it.

To try the app
`npm install`
`npm start` and `npx react-native run-android`

## Some Snapshots

<!-- ![Alt text](screenshots/ss-1.jpg "Optional title") -->
<!-- <img src="screenshots/ss-1.jpg" alt="Alt text" title=""> -->

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img width=300 src="screenshots/ss-1.jpg" alt="screenshot 1" title=""></td>
        <td><img width=300 src="screenshots/ss-2.jpg" alt="screenshot 2" title=""></td>
        <td><img width=300 src="screenshots/ss-3.jpg" alt="screenshot 3" title=""></td>
        <td><img width=300 src="screenshots/ss-4.jpg" alt="screenshot 4" title=""></td>
    </tr>
